This project submission is by Naman Jain

This project is a python based web crawler which will ask user for a directory name, url which is
supposed to be crawled and how much threads can be used for multithreading and create the directory with a queue and
crawled list inside.
Users can see all the urls of every sub domain inside the website which are related to domain.
Project speed is enhanced via the usage of threading and storage is done in the new directory created as per
user requirements.
